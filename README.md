## Features
- All (i think) apps that were reported as data colletors changed by a dummy .apk files that won't do anything.
- Disabled some Google Play Services analytics that won't harm your notification. The idea is to improve battery life.
- Some debug stuff disabled
- Disable adb debug notification. (The usb debug is ON by defuault)
- Some build.prop tweaks (you can check /common/system.prop for more info)

## Credits
- The idea was take from the original thread on [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5/themes/magisk-oneplus-analytics-disabler-t3686636) by senior member benwalburn 
- @topjohnwu for his awsome work on Magisk
- Google - yup, search engines are awesome
