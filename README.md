## Info
The module created to make your OxygenOS experience slightly better. I hope you'll notice a bit more battery efficiency and overall fluidity.
Feel free to contact me if you'll face any issues, i'll try to help and solve them.

## Features
- All (i think) apps that were reported as data colletors changed by a dummy .apk files that won't collect \ share any data.
- Disabled some Google Play Services analytics that won't harm your notification. The idea is to improve battery life.
- Some debug stuff disabled
- Disable adb debug notification. (The usb debug is ON by defuault)
- Some build.prop tweaks (you can check /common/system.prop for more info)

## Important
Some command (like GMS analytics disabling commands) executed 2-3 minutes after boot, so before you report any issues or something that doesn't work, please, wait around 3 minutes and check again.

## Credits
- The idea was take from the original thread on [XDA](https://forum.xda-developers.com/oneplus-5/themes/magisk-oneplus-analytics-disabler-t3686636) by senior member benwalburn
