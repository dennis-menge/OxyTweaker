## Disclaimer
I'm not responsible if you brick your device, miss your alarm clock or your gf will brake with you. Use at your own risk.

## Info
The module created to make your OxygenOS experience slightly better. The idea is to get rid of unneeded analytics & loggers inside OxygenOS and disabling some unneeded GMS services.
As a bonus there is few build.prop tweaks that will make the overall experience of using OOS - better.

The module compatible with ALL OnePlus devices since OnePlus 3 that runs OxygeonOS (Android 9 (Pie))!

## Features
- All (i think) apps that were reported as data colletors changed by a dummy .apk files that won't collect \ share any data.
- Disabled some Google Play Services analytics that won't harm your notification. The idea is to improve battery life.
- Some debug & system analytics stuff disabled
- Disable adb debug notification 
- Disable OP drivers pop-on on windows
- A bit faster animations
- More volume steps for media volume & in-call volume - i don't like the jump between two last steps on default value
- Some build.prop tweaks (you can check /common/system.prop for more info)

## Important
- Some commands (like GMS analytics disabling commands) executed 2-3 minutes after boot, so before you report any issues or something that doesn't work, please, wait around 3 minutes and check again.
- It is NOT recommended to use this module with that or another "ROM" module (for example xXx). I won't support any reported issues if you're using it.
- If you report any issue, please let me know - which OOS versions you're on, which kernel is used and what another magisk modules you have.
